 <h1>Jollof Rice and Chicken</h1>
    <h3>About the food</h3>
    <p>The origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Wolof or
         Jolof Empire in the 14th century, spanning parts of today's Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania, 
         where rice was grown. The dish has its roots in a traditional dish called thieboudienne,
         containing rice, fish, shellfish and vegetables.Jollof rice is one of the most common dishes in West Africa. 
         There are several regional variations in name and ingredients; for example, in Mali it is called zaamè 
         in Bamanankan. The dish's most common name of Jollof derives from the name of the Wolof people,
         though in Senegal and Gambia the dish is referred to in Wolof as ceebu jën or benachin. 
         In French-speaking areas, it is called riz au gras. Despite the variations, the dish is 
         "mutually intelligible" across the regions and has become the best known African dish outside the continent.

<h3>How to prepare Jollof Rice and Chicken</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Blend your tomatoes and pepper in a food processor or blender for about 45 seconds, make sure that everything is blended well.</li>
	<li>In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat. Once the oil is heated add the onions you set aside and fry just until they turn golden brown.</li>
	<li>Once the onions, have turned brown in color add the tomato paste and fry for 2-3 minutes. Then add the blended tomato mixture (reserve about 1/4 cup and set aside) and fry the mixture with the onions and tomato paste for about 30 minutes. Make sure you stir consistently so that the tomato mixture does not burn.</li>
	<li>After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, and add the chicken stock. Mix and add your seasonings (salt, curry powder, thyme, all purpose seasoning, and the bullion cube). Continue to boil for 10 minutes.</li>
	<li>Add the parboiled rice to the pot. Mix it very well with the tomato stew. At this point if you need to add water so that the rice is level with the tomato mixture/chicken stock go ahead and do so.cover the pot, and cook on medium to low heat for 15-30 minutes.</li>
	<li>When the liquid has almost dried up add the remaining tomato stew, cover, and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes heat until the liquid has completely dried up. </li>
	<li>Turn off the heat, mix thoroughly, and your Jollof Rice is ready to be eaten!</li>
	<li>Serve with fried chiicken.</li>
